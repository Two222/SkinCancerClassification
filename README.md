# SkinCancerClassification
In this problem we used deep learning to classify images of skin
lesions to enable detection of whether the skin lesion is
malignant or not. Two types of classification have been
performed:
a) Malignant (melanoma) vs benign (nevus and seborrheic
keratosis)
b) Melanocytic (melanoma and nevus) vs non-melanocytic
(seborrheic keratosis)
